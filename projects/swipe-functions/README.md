## Overview

This project provides a simple, easy-to-use, and consistent way to perform swipes in Tasker. It's designed to be used by other projects, has no profiles, and has been organized into a project to keep task lists tidy and organized, and to make sharing easier.

## Dependencies

This project is dependent on the [Wait Functions](https://github.com/c-d-smith/android-automation/tree/main/projects/wait-functions) project.

## Tasks/Functions

  * `Swipe Functions: Vertical`
  * `Swipe Functions: Horizontal`
  * `Swipe Functions: Clear Single App`

The first two tasks simply perform a vertical or horizontal swipe. The coordinates used in them may need to be modified, but I believe they should work for most devices.

The final task is intended to clear a single app from the `Recent Apps` list. Here again, the coordinates used in this task should work for most devices.

## Apps Required
