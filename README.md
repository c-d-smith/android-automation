# Android Automation

This is a collection of [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) projects I have written. These projects are provided in XML format. To use them, save the XML file to your phone and then import it into Tasker.

## Tasker

To use any of the projects I share here, you will need [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm). Some of these projects will also require one or more plugins for Tasker, and you will need the full versions of the plugins. The apps you need will be listed in each project, along with a link to that app in the Play store.

Tasker has a number of permissions that can be granted to it. You don't necessarily need to grant them all, and Tasker is pretty good about telling you what it needs and helping you to grant the permissions.

## Projects

Here is the list of projects I'm sharing (or plan to share):

  * [Call Screening](https://github.com/c-d-smith/android-automation/tree/main/projects/call-screening/README.md)
  * Claim Google Play Perks
  * [Delete PokemonGO Pictures](https://github.com/c-d-smith/android-automation/blob/main/projects/delete-pokemongo-pictures/README.md)
  * [Email Control](https://github.com/c-d-smith/android-automation/tree/main/projects/email-control/README.md)
  * [Toggle Vibrate for Meetings](https://github.com/c-d-smith/android-automation/tree/main/projects/toggle-vibrate-for-meetings/README.md)
  * [VirginPulse Wellness Tracking](projects/virginpulse-wellness-tracking/README.md)
  * [Volume Control](https://github.com/c-d-smith/android-automation/tree/main/projects/volume-control/README.me)

I have other projects that I'll eventually share. For now, these are the ones most likely to be useful to the most people.

On each project's README page, there will be a link to get the code from Google Drive and a link to get the code from an XML file in this repository. The Google Drive link should be preferred because, if there is a delay in getting this repository's XML updated for a project, the file linked from Google Drive will always be up-to-date. I will do my best to make sure the XML file in this repository gets updated very quickly after an updated project file is uploaded to Google Drive.

## Roadmap

As I have time, I hope to add videos that demonstrate how to manually re-create some of these projects in Tasker. The main idea behind the videos being that they might help someone learn more about, and get more comfortable with, programming in Tasker.

I also hope to add guides to help you grant the needed permissions for each project.

### Future Projects

Obviously, I tend to create projects based on my own needs. However, if you have a need or an idea and would like help with it, you can open an issue on this repository and I will take a look at it. Of course, there are no guarantees, but I really enjoy the challenge of trying to solve problems using Tasker.
