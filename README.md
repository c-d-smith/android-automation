# Android Automation

This is a collection of [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) projects I have written. These projects are provided in XML format. To use them, save the XML file to your phone and then import it into Tasker.

## Roadmap

As I have time, I will add videos that demonstrate how to manually re-create these projects in Tasker. The main idea behind the videos being that they might help someone learn more about, and get more comfortable with, programming in Tasker.

## Tasker

To use any of the projects I share here, you will need [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm). Some of these projects will also require one or more plugins for Tasker, and you will need the full versions of the plugins. The apps you need will be listed in each project, along with a link in the Play store.

Tasker has a number of permissions that can be granted to it. You don't necessarily need to grant them all, and Tasker is pretty good about telling you what it needs and helping you to grant the permissions. I plan to add guides to help you grant the needed permissions as I add projects to this repository.

## Projects

Here is the list of projects I'm sharing (or plan to share):

  * Reduce Volume During Workday
  * Toggle Vibrate for Meetings
  * Vacation Cancel Calendar Notifications
  * [VirginPulse Wellness Tracking](projects/virginpulse-wellness-tracking/README.md)

### Future Projects

Obviously, I tend to create projects based on my own needs. However, if you have a need or an idea and would like help with it, you can open an issue on this repository and I will take a look at it. Of course, there are no guarantees, but I really enjoy the challenge of trying to solve problems using Tasker.
